# Autonomous-Software-Release-Management
Abstract
The Autonomous Software Release Management system would, through artificial intelligence in the evaluation of several metrics including code stability, user feedback, and testing results, automate the release of software to promote efficiency in deployment while reducing risks and hence determine the best time autonomously for a release.

Existing System
Current practices for managing the release of software have mainly defaulted to manual processes and subjective judgment, which may lead to inefficiencies and a higher potential for mistakes. Teams often review code quality and user feedback through a combination of tools and processes, making it difficult to collectively make a call on whether software should be released.

Suggested System
The proposed system would utilize AI to automatically assess the stability of the code, user feedback, and test results through an all-round score guide for the release decision. The features of the system are:

Automated Analysis: Algorithm-based assessment of the quality of the code and the gathering of user feedback.
Release Decision Engine: Calculates the mean scores on different parameters to decide the viability of a given release.
Scheduling: Automatic scheduling of releases according to the results of analysis to achieve optimal deployment timing.
Software Requirements
Programming Language: Python 3.x

Libraries:
random for simulated scores
datetime for scheduling deployment releases
(Optional) Libraries of AI/ML such as scikit-learn for more complex analysis
Development Tools: IDE, preferably PyCharm or Visual Studio Code
Version Control: Git for source code management
Testing Framework: Testing tools like unit testing supported by unittest and pytest

Hardware Requirements
Processor: at least dual-core
RAM: at least 4 GB, 8GB or more for large datasets
Storage: At least 100 MB free space on the disk for software and libraries
Network: Stable availability of internet for online resources and updates

Conclusion
The Autonomous Software Release Management system will eradicate inefficiencies of today's processes by creating the easiest method to perform software releases in an automated fashion. Real-time analysis and decision-making capability within this system will greatly increase deployment efficiency and risk involved with software release. Future enhancements in terms of advanced analytics and user feedback mechanisms will formulate a powerful and smart release management solution.
